# 03 - Slot-Based and Adaptive Layouts with `ModalCard` view

## Introduction

The `ModalCard` view component is meant to be a reusable and _configurable_ modal by having it accept configurable parameters, both variables (state) and functions (behaviors);Â hence, an _adaptive_ layout that can be reused across apps.

Concepts being used in the `ModalCard` component build on top of the `Card` view component. Therefore, if you'd like to have a look at the `Card` view component before checking the `ModalCard`, head over to the <a href="">Card View Component</a> github project. It's quite a simple component, but you can take it as a groundwork for the `ModalCard` as well as more advanced components/frameworks I have coded.
